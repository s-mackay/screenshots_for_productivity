# screenshots_for_productivity
bigbrother.sh takes screenshots at jittered time intervals, saves and zips them to share with your home-office buddy

Suggested use for increased productivity: Make an arrangement to work (from home) for a certain amount of time.
E.g. for a 2h session with 15 screenshots named oct25_XX.jpg:
`bigbrother.sh oct25_ 120 15`
At the end of your work session, exchange zipfiles with your colleague and point out any non-work-related websites or apps you spotted. Or praise them for their focused work.

Images are scaled down considerably to keep image file sizes to a minimum.
Requires ImageMagick
